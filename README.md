# Development of a Diagnostic Test Probability Calculator

This was an assignment for my Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science class.

Objective: Design and implement an application that allows a user to input the prevalence of a disease, the sensitivity of a diagnostic test, and the specificity of the test. The application will then compute and display the probability of the disease given the test result.
